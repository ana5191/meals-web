# meals

  It's an website created to display various meals and details about them.
  It is created with Java using SpringBoot, Javascript, CSS and HTML. 
The database that I chose is H2 - it is a relational database. The tables
that I needed to store the information are: Area(used to store the origin
of the meals), Category(it stores the main categories of recipes),
Ingredients(contains a list of all ingredients), Meal( contains the details
of the meal and the cooking instructions), Meal_Composition(this table is
used to create the connection between the meal, its ingredients and
their corresponding quantity).
  In order to make the connection between backend and frontend I used
Javascript Fetch Function
DB file must be added in  C:/Temp/
